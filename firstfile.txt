The Government undertook a census of refugees in West Punjab in 1948, which displayed their place of origin in India.
A study of the total population inflows and outflows in the districts of the Punjab, using the data provided by the 1931 and 1951 Census has led to an estimate of 1.26 million missing Muslims who left western India but did not reach Pakistan.[101] The corresponding number of missing Hindus/Sikhs along the western border is estimated to be approximately 0.84 million.[128] This puts the total of missing people, due to Partition-related migration along the Punjab border, to around 2.23 million.[128] Another study of the demographic consequences of partition in the Punjab region using the 1931, 1941 and 1951 censuses concluded that between 2.3 and 3.2 million people went missing in the Punjab.[129]
